# Daily Diet app built on Ignite's React-Navite track (Rocketseat) 🚀

➡️ In this application, the user can add their diets by selecting whether it is in days or not, a statistic is shown with the results of that diet

➡️ We use techniques such as context, states, SectionList and FlatList to display the diets, JavaScript to calculate the result, useFocusEffect to capture whether the user changed screens. We also use Props Drilling to pass props from a parent component to a child component, we use Async Storage to avoid having to send props from parent to child components successively.

We use React-Native elements from within the styled component library like Image, View, TouchableOpacity, Text, etc. to create our components

### Some libraries we use in our application:

- react-native-async-storage/async-storage -> to store data on the user's device
- react-navigation/native-stack -> lib to create navigation in the screen stack, also through this lib we can send parameters through the routes
- phosphor-react-native -> lib to use icon packs in our interface
- react-native-safe-area-context -> lib so that application elements appear in the safe area of ​​the user's device
- styled-components -> lib to create components for our interface

### If you want to test the application on your machine, download this repository and in the repository terminal, run the command "npm run start" with Android Studio running the Android emulator 🚀
