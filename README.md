Daily Diet app built on Ignite's React-Navite track (Rocketseat)

In this application, the user can add their diets by selecting whether it is in days or not, a statistic is shown with the results of that diet

We use techniques such as context, states, SectionList to display the diets, JavaScript to calculate the result, useFocusEffect to capture whether the user clicked on the screen, etc...
